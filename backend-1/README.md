# Project Title

## Overview
This project is a backend application designed to handle authentication and authorization using JWT tokens. It includes middleware for token verification and serves as the entry point for the application.

## Features
- JWT token verification middleware
- Secure handling of authentication
- Easy integration with other services

## Installation
To install the project, follow these steps:
